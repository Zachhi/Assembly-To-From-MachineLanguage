Instructions for program:

1. compile program. 
    
    You can use: g++ assembler.h assembler.cpp table.cpp table.h main.cpp disassembler.h disassembler.cpp -o a.out
    And then to run it:    ./a.out

or compile to your liking.

2. add .txt or .hack or .asm file (whatever is being used to test) to repository

3. go to main.cpp function, this will be all you need.
4. for assembly, just call: assemble("testfilename.whatever")
5. for disassembly, just call: disassemble("testFileName.whatever")

6. after writing the functions, run the program with ./a.out or with whatever you like

7. these will automatically create .hack and .asm files with the result of the output
